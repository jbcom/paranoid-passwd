# CLAUDE.md — Agent Instructions Shim

**⚠️ DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. ALL INSTRUCTIONS ARE IN `AGENTS.md`.**

## For Claude Code / Claude in Terminal / Any Claude Instance

You are working on `paranoid`, a self-auditing cryptographic password generator.

**READ THIS FIRST**: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

`AGENTS.md` contains:
- Complete project documentation
- Agentic instruction layer for ALL LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- LLM clean room protocols
- Hallucination detection framework
- Supply chain security requirements
- Critical constraints and security policies

---

## Quick Reference

| Question | See Section in AGENTS.md |
|----------|--------------------------|
| What is this project? | §1: One-Line Summary |
| How do I build? | §Build System + docs/BUILD.md |
| Can I change crypto code? | §Critical Constraints (NO without human review) |
| How do I avoid hallucinations? | §LLM Clean Room Protocol |
| What's the threat model? | §LLM Threat Model + docs/THREAT-MODEL.md |
| How do I verify my changes? | §Verification Checklist |

## Critical Rules (Zero Exceptions)

1. **YOU are the adversary.** Treat all code you generate as potentially hallucinated.
2. **NEVER modify `src/paranoid.c` or `include/paranoid.h`** without human cryptographer review.
3. **NEVER add JavaScript fallbacks.** Fail-closed design is intentional.
4. **NEVER claim formulas are correct.** Always flag for verification.
5. **ALWAYS delegate RNG to OpenSSL.** Never generate random numbers directly.
6. **ALWAYS use rejection sampling** for uniform distribution (max_valid = (256/N)*N - 1).

## Before Making ANY Changes

Run the LLM Self-Audit Checklist from AGENTS.md §LLM Clean Room Protocol.
